## Overview

This is an R Markdown presentation that features a plot created with Plotly. My webpage is hosted on RPubs, and my rmd. file you can find at https://github.com/Vmudsam/DevelopingDataProductsWeek3.git. 


## Slide with Plot
This is a plot created with plotly.

```{r pressure}
library(plotly)
plot_ly(data = mtcars, x = ~wt, y = ~mpg, 
        color = ~as.factor(cyl), size = ~hp,
        text = ~paste("Weight: ", wt, '<br>MPG:', mpg),
        type = "scatter", mode = "markers") %>%
  layout(title = "Miles per Gallon depending on Weight and Cylinder Size of a car", xaxis=list(title="Weight"), yaxis=list(title="Miles per Gallon"))
```
